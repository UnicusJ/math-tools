#How to Contribute to the project:

When adding a new algorithm, please add some doctests at the top of your file, which demonstrate the expected output of your code.
Try to include a few edge cases, but don't go too overboard, 3 or 4 should be fine (probably.)

If making an improvement to an algorithm, just give a brief overview of why you are making the change, and how it improve the algorithm overall.

Can't wait to see what you come up with!
