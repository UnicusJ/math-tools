Contributing to the Project:

If you have a tool, algorithm, data structure implementation, or just generally
something cool to contribute, then feel free to make a pull request.

When adding a new algorithm, please add some doctests at the top of your file
(if relevant), which demonstrate the expected output of your code.
Try to include a few edge cases, but don't go too overboard, 3 or 4 should be
fine (probably.)

If making an improvement to an algorithm, just give a brief overview of why you
are making the change, and how it improve the algorithm overall.

Can't wait to see what you come up with, and happy coding :)
